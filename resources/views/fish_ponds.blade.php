                        An earthen pond is a near-natural habitation for fishes (catfish, tilapia, etc) like the river or stream. Although it is constructed to suit the design of the fish farmer, it is mostly constructed in the sloppy or waterlogged area to accommodate the fishes and make them have a natural feel when they are being raised.

                        An earthen pond is an artificial dam, a reservoir constructed by digging a hole that should be at least 1.5 meters deep. The process of constructing an earthen pond should be carried out by professionals who have been in the business of pond construction for a long time.

                        Factors To Consider Before Constructing An Earthen Pond <br>
                        Before choosing to construct an earthen pond, there are 2 crucial factors you need to consider:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text-muted">
                         <li>
                            Location of the land: The first thing to consider before deciding to dig an earthen pond is the location and choice of the land that will be used. One major key factor to choosing a land is that it must be in a place where there is natural water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                         Soil Type: The second factor to consider before building an earthen pond is the type of soil that will be used for construction. The best type of soil for the earthen pond is one that can hold water very well. This can be clay soil or sandy clay soil. Other factors to consider before constructing an earthen pond are soil permeability and soil texture.
                        </li>

                        A Concrete pond is using blocks, sands, and cement to build a habitation for you to raise your fish. Constructing concrete ponds requires the help of experts compared to other types of ponds. This is so because any mistake in the construction of the pond can lead to leakages and it might cost more to repair than to construct another one. One advantage of the concrete pond over the earthen pond is that it can be constructed anywhere eve in your house.

                            Drainage System: This is the second factor that is critical to constructing your concrete pond. A good drainage system where you will be disposing of the wastewater should be part of the planning process when you want to build a pond.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        This type of pond is common for beginners in fish farming. One of the benefits of the plastic pond (just like the tarpaulin pond) is that it is easy to set up. One amazing thing about the plastic pond is that you can turn the old overhead tank into ponds that can be used to raise catfish.

                         <li>
                            Space â€“ You only require a small space to put your plastic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Quantity â€“ When you are just starting fish farming and you want to use a plastic pond (which is advisable), the number of ponds you will buy should be considered depending on the number of fish you will be in there.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cost â€“ Sometimes if you donâ€™t have enough money with you, it is not advisable to buy a lot of plastic ponds for raising the fishes.
